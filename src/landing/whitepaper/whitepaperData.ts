    content2:
      "Lion City traces its origins back to a project known as Lucky Lions. In March 2022, 8888 lions were minted on the Cardano blockchain, marking the inception of our venture. However, the emerging bear market brought forth unforeseen challenges that led to the original founder's departure from the project, citing personal reasons. In the face of this pivotal change, a group of unwavering community advocates stepped forward with a collective determination to preserve the project's spirit. Guided by their dedication and a shared commitment to our goals, we embarked on a transitional phase. During this transformative period, a new leader emerged—one infused with a fresh vision. This leader shared an unyielding focus on our common objectives: the fusion of blockchain and cannabis industry communities within a vibrant, inclusive environment. It was in this moment that Lion City found its inception. The genesis of Lion City signifies a significant chapter in our journey—one marked by resilience and determination. These qualities have paved the way for a distinctive and flourishing ecosystem.",

    content:
      "In the ever-evolving landscape of blockchain, Web 3 projects, and NFTs, there exists a critical challenge that many projects overlook - the effective utilization of their potential in the marketing realm. A majority of projects limit their scope to the blockchain, offering innovative ways to trade or mint cryptocurrencies and NFTs. While these endeavors have their merits, they perpetuate a self-contained loop of funds circulating within the crypto space. This model restricts itself to a mere 10% of the world's financial activity, as a staggering 90% of global transactions still occur in fiat currencies.",
    subtitle2: "Problem 1: Limited Onboarding to the DEFI & Crypto Spaces",
    content2:
      "A significant contributing factor to this limited adoption of cryptocurrencies is the lack of effective onboarding strategies. Most crypto projects focus on attracting individuals who are already familiar with blockchain technologies, expecting potential users to independently navigate the complexities of this emerging field. However, the reality is that the vast majority of the global population lacks even a basic understanding of blockchain technology, making the onboarding process a daunting and often insurmountable obstacle for newcomers.",
    subtitle3: "Problem 2: Cannabis Industry Challenges",
    content3:
      " The cannabis industry faces significant hurdles, including limited payment options due to federal regulations and strict advertising restrictions resulting from a complex, fragmented legal landscape. Traditional banking services are often inaccessible to cannabis businesses, leaving them reliant on cash transactions. Additionally, digital advertising on popular social media platforms is constrained, hindering visibility for legally operating cannabis businesses in their respective regions. Federal regulations further compound these challenges, especially in countries where cannabis products maintain a national illegal status.",
